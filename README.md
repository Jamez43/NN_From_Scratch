# Summary
This project implements a neural network from scratch in Python using only NumPy â€” no external ML libraries. It supports ReLU, sigmoid, and softmax activations, binary cross-entropy loss, and the Adam optimizer. The model is trained on spiral data and visualizes decision boundaries for the test set.

# Key features:
- Custom forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent with Adam optimization
- Visualization of classification results with Matplotlib
- Demonstrates how deep learning models work without relying on TensorFlow/PyTorch
